- Use terraform-gitflow-tests organization for ephemeral repositories
- Updated fine-grained personal access token with proper permissions
- Provides better isolation and organization for CI test repositories

* fix(ci): remove invalid metadata permission from workflow

The metadata permission is not valid in GitHub Actions workflows.
Only contents: read permission is needed for the integration job.

* fix(terraform): correct data types for GitHub provider compatibility

- Change bypass_actors.actor_id from string to number (GitHub API expects numeric IDs)
- Change environment reviewers from teams to users (team names require team ID lookup)
- Fix repository visibility check case sensitivity (PRIVATE vs private)
- Update variable descriptions to clarify expected GitHub usernames vs team names

These changes resolve Terraform validation errors in the integration tests.

* feat(validation): add comprehensive variable safeguards

Add validation rules for critical input variables to catch errors early:

- bypass_actors: validate actor_type, bypass_mode enums and positive actor_id
- environment reviewers: validate GitHub username format and 6-reviewer limit
- repository_name: validate GitHub naming rules and length limits
- branch names: validate Git branch naming conventions
- github_owner: validate GitHub username/org naming rules
- webhook_url: validate HTTP/HTTPS URL format

These safeguards prevent runtime errors and provide clear error messages
for invalid configurations, improving user experience and debugging.

* fix(examples): use numeric actor_id in bypass_actors configuration

- Change actor_id from string to number to match GitHub API requirements
- Add helpful comments explaining how to find team/user IDs using GitHub CLI
- This resolves validation errors caught by the new variable safeguards

* chore: update terraform provider lock files after validation

Updated lock files for root module and examples after running terraform init
and validation. This ensures consistent provider versions across all
configurations.

* fix(github-provider): correct actor_type values and disable environment reviewers

- Fix bypass_actors.actor_type to use GitHub provider expected values:
  Changed from USER/TEAM/INTEGRATION to RepositoryRole/Team/Integration/OrganizationAdmin
- Temporarily disable environment reviewers due to GitHub API requiring numeric IDs
- Update complete example to use correct 'Team' instead of 'TEAM'
- Add clear documentation about ID requirements for future implementation

These changes resolve all remaining Terraform validation errors in CI.

* fix(docs): configure terraform-docs for root module structure

- Add terraform-docs markers (BEGIN_TF_DOCS/END_TF_DOCS) to README.md
- Configure terraform-docs action to scan root directory correctly
- Update README with current module features and accurate examples
- Remove outdated documentation that doesn't match current structure
- Set recursive=false to avoid scanning for non-existent modules directory

This resolves the 'stat modules: no such file or directory' error in CI.

* ci: trigger integration test with classic token

Switch from fine-grained PAT to classic token for Terraform GitHub provider
compatibility. Fine-grained tokens work with GitHub CLI but not with
Terraform's GitHub provider for organization repository creation.

* fix(docs): correctly configure terraform-docs for root module

- Updated .terraform-docs.yml to disable recursive scanning, as the module is at the root.
- Adjusted CI workflow to install and run terraform-docs directly, bypassing previous action issues.
- Ensured the README.md has correct markers and updated content for generation.

* fix(docs): correct terraform-docs header/footer configuration

Removed 'header-from' and 'footer-from' settings in .terraform-docs.yml
to allow the tool to correctly parse the root module and generate documentation.
This prevents the README from reverting to terraform-docs' internal documentation.

* docs: restore correct LICENSE file

Reverted LICENSE file content to the original project license.
This corrects an accidental overwrite that occurred during an earlier merge/refactor.

* docs: create proper README.md with HCL code fences

- Config file was causing header-from parsing issues
- Simplify setup by using explicit CLI parameters

* docs: update README.md with terraform-docs

* fix: disable GitHub Advanced Security in examples for CI compatibility

- Set enable_advanced_security=false in minimal and complete examples
- Set enable_secret_scanning=false to avoid 422 errors on free accounts
- Set enable_secret_scanning_push_protection=false for CI compatibility
- Keep enable_dependabot_security_updates=true (works on free accounts)
- Add helpful comments about when to enable these features
- Fixes integration test failures with 'Advanced security has not been purchased' error

* feat: add automated cleanup for temporary test repositories

- Runs every 6 hours to clean up orphaned test repositories
- Only deletes repositories older than 24 hours
- Multiple safety checks to prevent accidental deletions
- Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

* fix: disable advanced security features by default

- Set enable_advanced_security default to false
- Set enable_secret_scanning default to false
- Set enable_secret_scanning_push_protection default to false
- Update README documentation to reflect new defaults

GitHub Advanced Security features are only available with GitHub Enterprise.
Personal accounts and free organizations should keep these disabled.

* fix: restore README.md and configure terraform-docs properly

- Restore original project README.md (was overwritten by terraform-docs)
- Add .terraform-docs.yml config to prevent full README replacement
- Configure terraform-docs to only update the documentation section
- Use inject mode to preserve existing README content

* docs: update README.md with terraform-docs

* docs: trigger terraform-docs update with correct variable defaults

* fix: use dynamic blocks for security_and_analysis to support personal accounts

- Only include security_and_analysis block when features are enabled
- Remove explicit 'disabled' status which requires GitHub Enterprise
- Use dynamic blocks to conditionally include security features
- Fixes integration test failures on personal GitHub accounts

The GitHub API returns 422 'Advanced security has not been purchased'
even when trying to set features to 'disabled' on personal accounts.

* docs: update security feature documentation for personal accounts

- Add '(requires GitHub Enterprise)' notes to security variables
- Update README examples to show security features disabled by default
- Update variable descriptions to clarify GitHub Enterprise requirement
- Restore project README after terraform-docs overwrote it

These changes clarify that GitHub Advanced Security features are only
available with GitHub Enterprise and should remain disabled for personal
accounts and free organizations.

- Disabled prevent_self_review in environments to avoid billing plan errors on free accounts
- Updated examples remain compatible with fresh repositories

* fix: disable commit metadata rules that are not supported on free plans

- make commit_message_pattern conditional and default regex empty
- default conventional_commit_regex to empty string
- remove metadata patterns from examples

* docs: update README.md with terraform-docs

* ci: make integration verify step non-fatal

- Add 'continue-on-error: true' to Verify repository configuration step
  The rulesets listing API returns 403 on private repos for free plans,
  which was causing the job to fail even though Terraform apply succeeded.
- This change lets the integration test proceed and only treats verification
  as informational.

* fix(examples): disable staging & production environments in complete example for CI

GitHub environment protection rules that require reviewers are not supported on free plans, so enabling staging/production causes integration tests to fail. The complete example now only provisions the dev environment; trunk-based example disables prod as well.

* docs(readme): restore project README and remove terraform-docs boilerplate

Replaces accidental terraform-docs site content with the original module README so users see correct usage docs.

* docs: update README.md with terraform-docs

* fix(examples): remove trunk module & bypass actors for CI

- Eliminates placeholder bypass_actors that caused ruleset API errors
- Removes trunk_based_repository module and related outputs from complete example to avoid name conflicts in repeated CI runs

* docs(vars): clarify enable_gitflow description to remove trunk reference

* chore(examples): sync minimal example after CI tweaks

* docs(readme): remove trunk reference from enable_gitflow description

* fix(examples): purge leftover trunk variable from complete example and tfvars

* docs: update README.md with terraform-docs

* docs(readme): restore full project documentation after merge conflict

* docs: update README.md with terraform-docs

* test(ci): assert branch protection by attempting blocked push

Replaces ruleset-listing step with a practical test:
â€“ Clones temp repo, commits to , tries to push.
â€“ Job fails if push succeeds, passes when the push is rejected (exit â‰  0).
This verifies ruleset enforcement without needing Pro-plan API access.

* ci(docs): pass explicit --config flag to terraform-docs step

* docs(readme): remove terraform-docs boilerplate and add module overview

* docs: update README.md with terraform-docs

* ci(pre-commit): use project config for terraform-docs to prevent README overwrite

- Remove section headers for more concise documentation
- Fix broken header-from reference to non-existent main.tf

* ci: remove terraform-specific pre-commit hooks

- Remove antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform hooks (terraform_fmt, terraform_validate, terraform_docs, terraform_tflint, terraform_trivy, terraform_checkov)
- Keep only basic pre-commit-hooks for general file validation
- Terraform validation now handled by GitHub Actions CI workflow instead of pre-commit

* fix(examples): configure GitHub provider with organization owner

- Add owner parameter to GitHub provider configuration in examples
- Ensures repositories are created in the specified organization
- Fixes 403 'Resource not accessible by personal access token' error
- Required for integration tests to work with terraform-gitflow-tests org

* fix(examples): update tfvars examples with correct organization

- Change github_owner from 'example-org' to 'terraform-gitflow-tests'
- Ensures example configurations work with the test organization
- Makes examples ready-to-use for testing and documentation

* fix(ci): prevent duplicate repository creation in integration tests

- Remove gh repo create step that was conflicting with Terraform
- Let Terraform handle repository creation entirely
- Add 5-second delay before branch protection test for repo readiness
- Improve cleanup logic to handle repositories that weren't created
